RabbitMQ setup:

    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user espuser esppassword
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "/" espuser "^mqtt-subscription-ESP8266.*" ".*" ".*"
    ### where mqtt-subscription-XXXX is the queue that is declared by PubSubClient, and XXXX is the clientID passed in as the first parameter to the client.connect() routine

    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user rpiuser rpipassword
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "/" rpiuser "^mqtt-subscription-ESP8266.*" ".*" ".*"

to connect, you would have to do (Arduino) `client.connect("ESP8266...", "espuser", "esppassword")`

`client.subscribe('XXX') doesn't seem to do anything with respect to `XXX`

from the pub side, you really only need

    conn = pika.BlockingConnection( rmq_conn_params )
    channel = conn.channel()

    channel.basic_publish(
        exchange='',
        routing_key='mqtt-subscription-ESP8266 Clientqos0',
        body='wtf')
    conn.close()

That is, no need to declare any queues or exchanges, and use the default exchange.

Unresolved:  I can delete the wifi password and it still works.  Router DHCP
reservation just shooing in my client?
